My name is Pin Shuai and I am doing a post-doc at PNNL in Richland, WA. My research specializes in groundwater-surface water interactions and its impacts on biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone under dynamic forcing (i.e. hydropeaking or tidal pumping). I primarily use numerical models developed in [PFLOTRAN](https://www.pflotran.org/), [COMSOL](https://www.comsol.com/) and many other groundwater models. For a full bio, please see my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pshuai/) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2511-9828).
